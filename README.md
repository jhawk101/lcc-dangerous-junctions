# LCC - Dangerous Junctions

Volunteering project with LCC aiming to improve the identification of dangerous junctions.

Currently junctions are manually identified using [this tool](https://bikedata.cyclestreets.net/collisions/#9.54/51.5058/-0.1395). The currently identified junctions can be viewed [here](https://lcc.org.uk/campaigns/dangerous-junctions/).

I'm hoping to recreate and extend this work, see research so far in: `notebooks/`

See app with junctions identified with this approach [here](https://danielhills-lcc-dangerous-junctions-app-b63snl.streamlitapp.com/).
